This is a trivial project useful to determine where the stack, bss, heap,
code and constants reside for a program running on your platform.

HISTORY
The original program that I saw doing this was by ozzie ; see the blog 
blog.ooz.ie
I fixed a bug to do with setting up a proper BSS.  I also fixed a malloc
leak.  I then did a re-write of the program because I wanted a nice and
simple program which would appeal to introductory programmers from a low
level analysis / assembly analysis point of view.

I hope you enjoy the program!
